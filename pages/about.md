I am Tommi, I created this website. Let's skip the part about me, which you can read [on my personal website](https://tommi.space/home#about).

After several tormented months thinkering about the ups and downs of social media, I couldn’t stand it anymore. I was so stressed and obsessed about ethical issues today’s social networks have, I concluded **quitting** is the only way to feel better.

I figured out, though, that just quitting and taking no more action is useless. How many people around the world have my same toughts and concerns? How can I share the crucial importance of doubting about the way social media platforms work, in the best possible way, with all of my firends? How to foster curiosity, need for knowledge and concern about the way most of our online relations happen these days?

Simply abandoning social media platforms changes nothing.

Let’s be honest: having no account on Facebook, Instagram, nor Twitter today could easily seem as being left out of social relations and live in a quiet, peaceful, yet isolated bubble. Nevertheless, if you're not alone, it’s not like that.

This website has three main purposes:

- Listing in a unique place all of the articles, researches, documentaries, interviews, material, etc. which proves how the risks and damages of social media outweight their (still great) vantages.
- Being a reference point for all social media quitters, a growing global community, to provide efficiently and clearly their arguments.
- Allowing skeptical and indifferent social media users to understand how individual and personal choiches are crucial and fundamental to improve online experience and making the internet a better place.

I’m aware of all the great and awesome communities which promote internet freedom and social media corporations independence, but I feel that there’s a critical aknowledgement which isn’t stressed out enough: **actions of the individual are the key to global change**. We should’t wait for policies and laws to be rolled out; in the same way, we can’t believe someone else will come and make everything better, someday.

**!!** I absolutely don’t want to force you to quit social media, and I definitely don’t want to convince you it’s the best thing to do. I want anybody who lands here to carefully go through the website’s content and the referenced material, to acquire enough knowledge to decide by him/herself what's the best thing to do.

We need to understand, read, be informed and study what’s happening.

Then, unite, stand out and be (part of) the change.

Quit Social Media, for a start.

## Notes

- I chose the `.club` domain because it was among the cheapest and, in the end, it makes sense.
- I want to point out I have absolutely no personal gain in creating this website and in spamming it everywhere. On the contrary, I invested so much time in writhing these words and building this virtual place (I’m not a developer) I became so tired and stressed I came close to giving up several times. (Once, I was so sleepy that by mistake I deleted the working directory of this website, irremediably losing months of hard work)
- I don’t expect for this website to become viral, but, deep inside me, I strongly hope so.
